# Building a Golang CLI Program with OpenAI's GPT-3

In this article, we will walk through the process of building a command-line interface (CLI) program in Go that interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The program will take a prompt from the user, send it to the GPT-3 model, and execute the generated command in the terminal.

## Setting Up the CLI Program

The first step is to set up the CLI program to accept various flags and arguments. We use the `flag` package in Go to define the flags. The flags we'll use are:

- `-key`: to set the OpenAI API key.
- `-unsave`: to set the OpenAI API key without saving it.
- `-prompt`: to set the prompt for the OpenAI API.
- `-dir`: to set the directory for the .key file.
- `-help`: to show the help message.

The API key can be saved in a file in the user's home directory for future use, or it can be provided with each command without being saved. The prompt is the text that will be sent to the GPT-3 model to generate a command.

## Interacting with the OpenAI API

The next step is to send a request to the OpenAI API with the prompt and the API key. We use the `net/http` package in Go to create an HTTP POST request, and the `encoding/json` package to encode the request body as JSON.

The request body includes the model ID, the prompt, and various parameters that control the output of the model. The model ID for GPT-3 is "text-davinci-003".

Once we get the response from the API, we parse it to extract the generated command. The command is in the `choices` array in the response body, and each choice has a `text` property that contains the generated text.

## Executing the Generated Command

After we have the generated command, we show it to the user and ask if they want to accept, modify, or cancel. If the user accepts, we execute the command in the terminal using the `os/exec` package in Go. If the user wants to modify, we re-run the function to generate a command and ask the user again. If the user cancels, we exit the program.

To execute a command, we use the `exec.Command` function to create a new command, and the `Start` method to start the command in the background. We can capture the output of the command and print it to the console.

## Conclusion

Building a CLI program in Go that interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3 model is a multi-step process that involves setting up the CLI program, sending a request to the OpenAI API, parsing the response, and executing the generated command. With the power of GPT-3, we can generate a wide variety of commands based on user prompts, making this a versatile tool for automating tasks in the terminal.
